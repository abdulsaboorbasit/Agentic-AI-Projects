# Agentic AI Projects

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Projects** repository! This is a collection of practice projects aimed at exploring the exciting field of agentic AI. The projects here demonstrate various implementations and experiments as part of my learning journey in mastering agentic AI concepts and applications.

## About Agentic AI
Agentic AI refers to systems that can make decisions and take actions autonomously, often simulating behaviors like planning, reasoning, and goal-oriented problem-solving. These projects delve into the foundations of agentic AI and provide hands-on examples of its practical use cases.

## What's Inside?
- **Beginner Projects**: Simple implementations to understand the basics of agentic AI.
- **Intermediate Projects**: Projects with more complexity, introducing real-world scenarios and challenges.
- **Advanced Experiments**: Cutting-edge ideas and deep dives into agentic AI capabilities.

Each project comes with its own folder containing:
- **Code**: Well-documented Python scripts.
- **Explanation**: A brief overview of the project.
- **Results**: Outputs or insights derived from the implementation.

## Prerequisites
To run the projects, you will need:
- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Required Python libraries (specified in each project's `requirements.txt`)
